Introduction to the Wizard's Toolkit

The Wizard's Toolkit includes command line utilities to encipher plaintext,
decipher ciphertext, report properties associated with ciphertext, compute the
message digest of a file, and read message digests from a file and
authenticate them. In addition, the Wizard's Toolkit includes a a
cross-platform C API that includes a number of enciphering and hash methods
many developers should find useful in their projects.

The Wizard's Toolkit is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary
distribution or as source code that you may freely use, copy, modify, and
distribute. Its license is compatible with the GPL. It runs on all major
operating systems.

Features and Capabilities

Here are just a few examples of what the Wizard's Toolkit command line
utilities can do:

    * Convert plaintext to ciphertext
    * Convert ciphertext to plaintext
    * Report properties associated with ciphertext.
    * Compute the message digest of a file.
    * Read message digests from a file and verify them.

Here are just a few examples of what the Wizard's Toolkit Application
Programming Interface can do:

    * Return files as Binary Large OBjectS
    * Write/read characters, shorts, words, and long words to/from a file
    * Compute a cyclic redunancy checksum
    * Handle C exceptions
    * Generate a secure hash (includes MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384,
    * and SHA-512)
    * Generate a keyed-hash for message authentication
    * Encipher/decipher messages (includes AES, Serpent, and Twofish)
    * Authenticate a user (only secret-key supported at this time)
    * Map content with its associated mime type and file extension
    * Log events to the console or XML-style file
    * Anonymous memory-mapped memory allocation/deallocation
    * Increase entropy with message compression
    * Generate cryptographically-strong random numbers
    * Acquire/relinquish resources
    * Acquire/relinquish semaphores
    * Store/retrieve key-value pairs to/from a hashmap or linked-list
    * Store/retrieve key-value pairs to/from a self-adjusting binary tree
    * Parse or generate a XML document
    * Convenience methods for dealing with strings
